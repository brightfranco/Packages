AutoFileName: Autocomplete Filenames in Sublime Text
=====================================================
Do you ever find yourself sifting through folders in the sidebar trying to remember what you named that file? Can't remember if it was a jpg or a png? Maybe you just wish you could type filenames faster. *No more.*

Whether your making a `img` tag in html, setting a background image in css, or linking a `.js` file to your html (or whatever else people use filename paths for these days...), you can now autocomplete the filename. Plus it uses the built-in autocomplete, so no need to learn another *pesky* shortcut.

*UPDATE: There is now support for url(PATH_TO_FILE); however, it will not trigger as unless you prepend with `./` or leave the current directory.  A better solution is welcome.
